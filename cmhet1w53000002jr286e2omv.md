Through hard work and with incredible encouragement from the community, I was thrilled to get the opportunity to attend the **3rd Wikimedia Technology Summit (WTS 2024) in Hyderabad**.

When I received the selection email, I couldn’t contain my excitement. I am always curious to learn new things, and this was the perfect opportunity. Without hesitation, I packed my bags and headed to Hyderabad with my team, eager to experience everything the event had to offer.

What makes this moment even more special is that **this achievement got featured in the newspaper!** Seeing my institution, **SHUATS**, highlighted for this opportunity is a moment of immense pride for me and everyone associated with it. This opportunity truly feels like a milestone, and I am incredibly proud to represent SHUATS at such a significant event.

### A Community That Feels Like Family

From the moment I stepped in, the environment felt warm and welcoming—almost like being at home.

The people were incredibly friendly and helpful, treating each other like family members. It didn’t matter your age, gender, or level of knowledge; everyone was there to support and uplift one another. It was a space where doubts were openly addressed, connections were made, and everyone shared a collective eagerness to learn and explore.

One of the most inspiring parts of the summit was how seamlessly **Wikipedians and Wikimedians connected**. There was no barrier to networking; you could approach anyone at any time. Every second felt like an opportunity to learn something new, and I soaked up every bit of it.

### A Highlight: Mentorship and Expert Guidance

During the summit, I had the chance to meet one of the most knowledgeable Wikimedians I know: **Abhijeet Patro**, a Staff Software Engineer for Language Engineering at the Wikimedia Foundation.

He had an incredible depth of expertise in Wikimedia open source and was extremely generous in sharing it. He guided me on how to approach larger, more complex projects. This advice not only helped me sharpen my skills but also gave me the confidence to tackle more ambitious challenges in the future. His mentorship was one of the personal highlights of the event for me.

### An Unforgettable Experience

As the summit came to an end, we wrapped up with a group photography session. It was a beautiful way to celebrate the connections we had made and the knowledge we had gained. We shared ideas, made plans to collaborate on bigger projects, and left with a renewed sense of purpose and community.

Attending the Wiki 3rd Tech Summit in Hyderabad was an unforgettable experience. It wasn’t just about learning technical skills; it was about being part of a community that thrives on collaboration, respect, and mutual growth.
