Last year, I travelled to Hyderabad for a gathering that would quietly reshape my journey as a contributor and mentor—the [**3rd Wikimedia Technology Summit (WTS) 2024**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/3rd_Wikimedia_Technology_Summit_\(WTS_2024\)), hosted at IIIT Hyderabad. Walking into the campus felt like stepping into a space filled with curiosity, purpose, and an unmistakable sense of community. As a mentor with **WikiClub Tech – Road to Wiki**, the experience was more than just attending a summit; it was witnessing how far our collective efforts had come.

## **A Warm Start: The Mini-Hackathon**

The summit technically began a day early with an energetic [mini-hackathon](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/3rd_Wikimedia_Technology_Summit_\(WTS_2024\)/Programme/MiniHackathon) that set the tone for everything that followed. For many of us, this was where the ecosystem opened up in unexpected ways.

I still remember the moment I discovered [**Phabricator**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Phabricator), learned how tags like [*Good First Task*](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Good_first_bugs) and *Welcome Patch* guide newcomers, and understood how even the smallest patch can become the foundation of a bigger contribution journey.

More importantly, this day brought me face-to-face with the people whose names I had only seen online:

* [**Praveen Das (WMF)**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:PDas_\(WMF\)), patient and thoughtful with beginners
    
* [**Rachit Sharma (WMF)**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:RASharma_\(WMF\)), always smiling, always encouraging
    
* [**KC Velaga (WMF)**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:KCVelaga_\(WMF\)), someone whose mentorship would shape the months ahead
    
* [**Abijeet Patro (WMF)**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:APatro_\(WMF\)), who later became a guiding presence during the summit
    
* [**Gopa Vasanth**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Gopavasanth), energetic and community-driven
    
* [**Satdeep Gill (WMF)**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:SGill_\(WMF\)), calm and clear in his vision
    
* [**Jay Prakash**](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jayprakash12345), whose MediaWiki expertise inspired everyone

# **Day 2: Community, Collaboration, and Looking Forward**, The Day That Changed How I Think About Community

### **Opening Session**

A quick recap reminded us how much we had absorbed in just one day—then we jumped straight into deeper conversations.

### **Panel on Gender Gap in Tech**

One of the most meaningful sessions addressed gender representation in Wikimedia technology. The stories shared here reminded us why inclusive communities aren’t optional—they’re the foundation of sustainable growth.

### **Breakout Sessions**

Two rounds of breakouts covered nearly every corner of the Wikimedia tech universe:

* [IMWDUG](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Indic_MediaWiki_Developers_User_Group)’s annual plan
    
* Mobile editing workflows
    
* Unconference discussions
    
* Grassroots empowerment via [VGLUG](https://vglug.org/)
    
* Data visualization for WikiProject insights
    

These smaller rooms were where real problem-solving happened. Everyone had something to share, and everyone had something to learn.

# **A Mentorship Moment I’ll Always Remember**

Amid everything happening around us, I had the chance to sit down with **Abhijeet Patro**, who took the time to guide our group through the practicalities of contributing to Wikimedia’s technical spaces. That short conversation gave me clarity I had been searching for—how to navigate patches, how to choose tasks, and how to build for impact.

That short conversation did what entire workshops sometimes fail to do.  
It gave direction.

# **The People Who Shaped My Summit**

Throughout the event, I found myself constantly learning from mentors, contributors, and fellow developers. Every hallway conversation felt like unlocking a new door. Every session felt like an invitation to build something meaningful.

# **Why This Summit Mattered**

WTS 2024 was unlike any event I’ve attended. It brought together researchers, technologists, students, volunteers, open-source enthusiasts, and long-term Wikimedians—a crowd that would rarely share the same room otherwise.

Across two days, more than 150 participants explored how to strengthen Indic language access on the internet, build powerful open-source tools, and nurture young contributors through initiatives like WikiClubs. We spoke about challenges, but more importantly, we spoke about possibilities.

The conversations were bold, honest, and deeply collaborative. They asked:  
**How do we build the future of knowledge—together, openly, and inclusively?**

What stayed with me was this thought:  
**The future of open knowledge won’t be built by individuals.  
It will be built by communities who believe in sharing.**

And at Hyderabad, I saw that community in action.

WTS 2024 wasn’t just another conference. It didn’t offer one single answer—it offered many starting points for the future we’re building together.

# Press & Media Coverage of WTS 2024

The summit did more than bring people together—it generated buzz and media attention, signalling that the work of the Wikimedia movement and Indic-language open knowledge is gaining wider recognition.

### **Headline coverage**

* According to a press release published in Business Standard, the summit drew “technologists, developers, and volunteer contributors of Wikimedia projects from all over the country,” highlighting its inclusive, cross-community mission. ([Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/content/press-releases-ani/wikimedia-technology-summit-2024-brings-together-tech-enthusiasts-and-developers-to-bring-inclusivity-to-wikipedia-and-wikimedia-projects-124100800340_1.html))
    
* The article noted the event theme — *“Wiki Tech for All: Empowering Voices, Expanding Horizons”* — and the focus on smaller language communities, hands-on training for students, and advanced tool showcases. ([Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/content/press-releases-ani/wikimedia-technology-summit-2024-brings-together-tech-enthusiasts-and-developers-to-bring-inclusivity-to-wikipedia-and-wikimedia-projects-124100800340_1.html))
    
* A local report in Hyderabad Mail echoed these points and added details about the venue (International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad + Hyatt Gachibowli) and the number of attendees (around 130) from across India. ([Hyderabad Mail](https://hyderabadmail.com/wikimedia-technology-summit-2024-iiit-hyderabad/))

### **Key messages from coverage**

* **Inclusivity and languages**: Many articles emphasised how the summit strove to bridge the gap for Indic languages — both by tech tools and by community building. ([Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/content/press-releases-ani/wikimedia-technology-summit-2024-brings-together-tech-enthusiasts-and-developers-to-bring-inclusivity-to-wikipedia-and-wikimedia-projects-124100800340_1.html))
    
* **Community + tech synergy**: Reports highlighted the collaboration between students, volunteers, developers, and research institutions — making it clear the summit was more than a technical meetup. ([Hyderabad Mail](https://hyderabadmail.com/wikimedia-technology-summit-2024-iiit-hyderabad/))
    
* **Media reach = movement reach**: The fact that mainstream media covered the event suggests that the summit’s message is resonating beyond just the Wikimedia community.
    

### Why this Matters

* **Validation**: When events like WTS 2024 are covered in media, it validates the work of volunteers and community members—they aren’t just working in the shadows.
    
* **Awareness**: Press coverage reaches new audiences—students, educators, tech professionals—who might not yet know about Wikimedia’s open-source movement or the need for regional-language support.
    
* **Momentum**: Media stories help carry momentum. They communicate that innovations, tools, and communities are active and evolving, inviting more people to join.

# **A Heartfelt Thank You**

None of this would have been possible without the dedication of the [**IndicWiki Project team**](https://indicwiki.iiit.ac.in/) **at IIIT Hyderabad**. Their efforts in planning, coordination, program design, documentation, and execution created a space where learning was effortless and collaboration felt natural.

Leaving Hyderabad, I carried more than just notes and contacts.  
I carried a sense of belonging—and an even stronger commitment to contribute.
