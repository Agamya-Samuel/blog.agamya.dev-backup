The event began with my interactive session on no-code **Mobile App Development**, where we discussed the evolving ecosystem of mobile technologies, open collaboration, and how students can integrate Wikimedia APIs and open datasets into innovative applications.

Students actively participated with questions, shared their ideas, and took part in a **faculty-student Q&A panel**, making the session dynamic and engaging.

Following this, **Ankit Kumar Verma** introduced the audience to the **Wikimedia Movement**, its mission, and the philosophy behind *free knowledge for everyone*. He also spoke about the **Road to Wiki Program**, and how it helps bridge the gap between aspiring developers and the global Wikimedia technical ecosystem.

Later, **Aditya Kumar** shared valuable insights into **open-source contribution** — from setting up development environments to understanding collaborative tools used in Wikimedia’s technical projects.
