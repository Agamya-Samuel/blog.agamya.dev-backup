I was thrilled to be selected to participate in the **Indic Wikimedia Hackathon Kochi 2025**, which took place from July 25-27 at TinkerSpace, Kochi.

This was a fantastic opportunity to connect with the community, and I am incredibly grateful to the **Indic MediaWiki Developers User Group** for their support, which made my participation possible.

### ðŸš€ About the Event

The **Indic Wikimedia Hackathon Kochi 2025** was a regional event organized by the **Indic MediaWiki Developers User Group** (Indic-TechCom) in collaboration with **amFOSS**.

* **Location:** TinkerSpace, Kochi
    
* **Dates:** 25, 26 & 27 July 2025 (with 24 July as Day 0)
    

The primary goal of the hackathon was to provide a hands-on, beginner-friendly experience for students in and around Kochi, as well as members of the FOSS club at Amrita University.

The event was perfectly designed for those with some prior open-source experience, helping us get onboarded with the MediaWiki technical space. We focused on web-based tools, user scripts/gadgets, bots, and templatesâ€”all crucial components that help streamline the workflows of Wikimedia contributors.

### ðŸ’» My Contributions and Experience

The hackathon was a whirlwind of productive energy and collaboration. For my part, I had the opportunity to dive deep into the technical side and **contribute to several existing projects**.

Working alongside fellow developers, I was able to learn, share knowledge, and make tangible contributions. The environment was incredibly supportive, and it was a great experience to collaborate with other passionate individuals dedicated to improving the Wikimedia ecosystem.

Events like these are vital for the open-source community. A huge thank you to the organizers, **Indic-TechCom** and **amFOSS**, for putting together such a well-structured and impactful hackathon. I left the event feeling inspired and even more motivated to continue contributing.
